Yields: 4 servings
Prep time: 30 minutes (plus marination time)
Cook time: 45-60 minutes

Ingredients:

For the Chicken:

1 whole chicken (about 2-2.5 kg), cut into quarters
1 tablespoon olive oil
Juice of 1 lemon
For the Marinade:

1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/4 cup tomato paste
4 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon lemon juice
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1 tablespoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon turmeric
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)
Salt to taste
For Serving:

Flatbreads
Hummus
Tahini sauce
Fresh vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, onions)
Instructions:

Prepare the Chicken: Rinse the chicken pieces and pat them dry. Rub them with olive oil and lemon juice.
Make the Marinade: In a large bowl, combine all the marinade ingredients. Mix well to form a smooth paste.
Marinate the Chicken: Add the chicken pieces to the marinade and coat them thoroughly. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight for best results.
Preheat the Grill: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If using an oven, preheat to 200째C (400째F).
Grill the Chicken: Remove the chicken from the marinade and place the pieces on the grill. Cook for 15-20 minutes per side or until cooked through, basting occasionally with any leftover marinade. If using an oven, bake for 45-60 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through.
Serve: Serve the Shawaya hot with warm flatbreads, hummus, tahini sauce, and a side of fresh vegetables.
Tips:

For a smoky flavor, add a few wood chips to your grill.
To ensure even cooking, use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the chicken. It should reach 75째C (165째F) in the thickest part.
You can adjust the amount of spices in the marinade to suit your taste preferences.
Enjoy this authentic Saudi Arabian Shawaya and savor the flavors of the Middle East!
